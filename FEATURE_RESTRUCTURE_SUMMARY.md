### üîí Security Architecture
- **Authentication**: Secure HTTP-only cookies with Supabase
- **Authorization**: Role-based component and API protection
- **Data Security**: Input validation, XSS prevention, SQL injection protection
- **Session Management**: Automatic refresh and timeout handling

### üìä Role Hierarchy
1. **Administrator**: Full system access, all user/division management
2. **Divisional Manager**: Division-specific user management only
3. **Analyst**: Case analysis and reporting access
4. **Investigator**: Field operations and investigation tools
5. **System Support**: Technical support and diagnostics

## Performance Optimizations

### Database
- **Efficient Queries**: Indexed searches with proper pagination
- **User Count Calculation**: Real-time division member counting
- **Caching Strategy**: Smart caching with automatic invalidation
- **Selective Loading**: Load only required data fields

### Frontend
- **Component Memoization**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Debounced Search**: Reduce API calls during typing
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components only when needed
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large datasets efficiently

## Key Implemented Features

## API Architecture

### RESTful Endpoints
```
/api/users          # User management with RBAC
/api/divisions      # Division management
/api/user/profile   # Profile management
/api/auth/*         # Authentication endpoints
```

### Security Features
- Role-based endpoint protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
